## Description
Minefield/minesweeper style game, in which the player navigates from one side of a chessboard grid (4x4) to the other whilst trying to avoid hidden mines. 
The player has 3 lives, losing one each time a mine is hit, and the final score is the number of moves taken in order to reach the other side of the board.
